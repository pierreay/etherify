* Leak Source

Transmitting an electromagnetic wave imply to have a conductor driven by a
(high) frequency source. Various busses are used: monitor cables, PCI buses,
etc. Here, we use Ethernet interface and cable.

An Ethernet cable consists of 4 twisted pair lines, which carries RF signals
from 10 to 100 MHz range. Any imperfections in the cable (asymmetry, etc.) or
in the interface will cause radio signals to be radiated.

Ethernet speeds have different modulation speeds, types and encoding. By
switching between them, we can modulate the RF signal leaking from the wires.

* Encoding

- 10base-T uses Manchester Encoding with 10MHz symbol rate. This is used as the
  space signal (logical 0).
- 100base-T uses 4B5B encoding with NRZI at 125MHz symbol rate. This results in
  an easy to receive signal around 125MHz, this is used as the mark signal
  (logical 1).
- Ethernet transmits an idle sequence when no packets are carried, so the
  signal is constant. No packets have to be transmitted for the signal to be
  present, only the speed of the interface has to be changed.

* Prerequisites

We use morse code for simplicity, allowing to judge the signal to noise ratio
by just listening. It is possible to decode it by ear, otherwise there is a lot
of software that can do it -- although usually with much worse performance than
an experienced human operator.

Transmission is implemented via very simple shell scripts. Only bash, ethtool
and ping is needed.

* Etherify 4

Changing the interface speed take about about 2-5 seconds with most
hardware. This is unacceptable for sending regular morse code. Radio-amateurs
have an answer to this: QRSS CW (CW is morse code in ham radio speak). In QRSS
CW, the symbol length is increased to a few seconds or more, and the morse code
is decoded by eye from a slow spectrogram or by ear.

Steps:
1. Connect the computer (here, a Lenovo Thinkpad T460) to a router or another
   computer with an Ethernet cable -- an Ethernet link must be negotiated and
   established to 100 or 1000 mbps.
2. Connect the SDR to the computer and place the antenna close (between 5 and
   10 cm) to the Ethernet cable.
3. Manually identify the leak. Tune around 125 MHz (or harmonics of 250 MHz,
   375 MHz etc.) with 250 KS of sample rate with GQRX and change the Ethernet
   connection speed between 10 and 100 mbps:
   #+begin_src bash
   sudo ethtool -s enp0s31f6 autoneg off duplex full speed 100
   #+end_src
   #+CAPTION: Signal emitted at 125 MHz with an Ethernet link to 100 mbps
   [[file:imgs/100mbps.png]]
   #+begin_src bash
   sudo ethtool -s enp0s31f6 autoneg off duplex full speed 10
   #+end_src
   #+CAPTION: Signal emitted at 125 MHz with an Ethernet link to 10 mbps
   [[file:imgs/10mbps.png]]
4. Use GQRX to hear the morse code of =wisec= (i.e. =.-- .. ... . -.-.=), using
   =CW-U= demodulation in the =Mode= selector of the =Receiver Options= panel,
   while running Etherify:
   #+begin_src bash
   sudo ./etherify4.sh secret.txt
   #+end_src
