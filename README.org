* Etherify 4

1. Connect the computer (here, a Lenovo Thinkpad T460) to a router or another
   computer with an Ethernet cable -- an Ethernet link must be negotiated and
   established to 100 or 1000 mbps.
2. Manually identify the leak. Tune around 125 MHz (or harmonics of 250 MHz,
   375 MHz etc.) with 250 KS of sample rate with GQRX and change the Ethernet
   connection speed between 10 and 100 mbps:
   #+begin_src bash
   sudo ethtool -s enp0s31f6 autoneg off duplex full speed 100
   #+end_src
   #+CAPTION: Signal emitted at 125 MHz with an Ethernet link to 100 mbps
   [[file:imgs/100mbps.png]]
   #+begin_src bash
   sudo ethtool -s enp0s31f6 autoneg off duplex full speed 10
   #+end_src
   #+CAPTION: Signal emitted at 125 MHz with an Ethernet link to 10 mbps
   [[file:imgs/10mbps.png]]
3. Use GQRX to hear the morse code of =wisec= (i.e. =.-- .. ... . -.-.=), using
   =CW-U= demodulation in the =Mode= selector of the =Receiver Options= panel,
   while running Etherify:
   #+begin_src bash
   sudo ./etherify4.sh secret.txt
   #+end_src
